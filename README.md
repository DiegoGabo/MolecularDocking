##General Description
This project was done at Politecnico di Milano within the European project ANTAREX in a group of 3 people.
I developed in c++ an application which emulates the workload of the geometric approach to molecular
docking, a method which predicts the preferred orientation of one molecule to a second. I wrote three versions
of the same program: not parallelized, parallelized with OpenMP and parallelized with OpenCL. For this work I
was quoted on the acknowledgments of the following paper: “An easy-to-use library for dynamic generation
and invocation of multiple code versions”.
